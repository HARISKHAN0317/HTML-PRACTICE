         Rainy Season, or the wet season, <S>is one among the four seasons when the regionâ€™s average rainfall is achieved</S>. It is generally caused due to changes in the flow of winds and other geological factors. Generally, the rainy season brings much-needed relief from the extreme heat of the preceding summer season, replenishing the rivers and lakes. Plants that were previously wilted spring to life in the rainy season.</font>
